# HPSC-HW-2
My attempt at a course assignment. The problem statement requires us to implement matrix multiplication and
upper triangularization (Gaussian elimination et cetera) using OpenMP and MPI, and then compare the implementations
with each other.

See header files for API.

Run `make test` to run tests in `src/test.c`
Run `make testdbg` to run tests with debug printing enabled
